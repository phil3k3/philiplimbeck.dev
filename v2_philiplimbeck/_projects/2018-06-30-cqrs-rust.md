description: A CQRS (Command-Query Response Segregation) framework in a language with a different paradigm in terms of memory-management.

When talking about microservices, inevitably paradigms like event-driven architecture and CQRS (Command-Response Segregation Principle) 
have to be considered. 

Rust is an interesting language as it introduces a new paradigm different to languages such as Java/Go (garbage 
collection/.NET) and C/C++ (manual memory management). It is directly compiled to native code, but doesn't require
manual allocation of memory. It achieves this by having a strict mechanism called the borrow checker
which checks object usage during compile time, flagging any potential memory issues. 

Hence, I started a small open-source project with the aim of learning Rust. It provides 
a simple framework to handle protobuf-based messages which represent commands, command responses and events.

    Note over Command Service Client,Command Server: Send CQRS command

    deactivate Command Server
    Note over Command Server,Command Service Client: CQRS command response (Ok/Not Ok)
    par Command Server to Event Listener A
        Command Server-->>Event Listener A: User 'Bob' created
    and Command Server to Event Listener B
        Command Server-->>Event Listener B: User 'Bob' created
    end
    Note over Command Server,Event Listener A: Produce a CQRS event
