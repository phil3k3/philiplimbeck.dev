## XType

### Description:
Migrating the existing solution from a monolith which doesn't scale to an event-driven architecture based on Kafka. The solution extracts data from ServiceNow and links it together with items regarding the same logical entity. Those logical entities form deployment units which can be moved around on available ServiceNow instances. The ServiceNow instances are labelled according to QA, production, etc., forming stages in a CI/CD process.

### Responsibilities:
- Facilitated workshops about event-driven architecture and Kafka
- Guided the engineering team in creating a more scalable architecture to eventually supersede their monolith
- Implemented a prototype of a Kafka-based data pipeline reading from ServiceNow and producing a graph-based collection of business items

### Achievements:
- Rolled out a prototype to their test environment, reducing latency for item ingestion and processing from 24 hours to near real time
- Demonstrated concepts and best-practices for future services

### Languages:
- Java, Protobuf

### Datastores:
- Kafka, PostgreSQL

### Frameworks:
- Spring/Spring Boot, Kafka Streams, Kubernetes

### Concepts:
- Event Driven Architecture

### Cloud:
- Amazon Web Services EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

### Tools:
- ArgoCD, Jenkins, Maven, Grafana, Prometheus, AlertManager
