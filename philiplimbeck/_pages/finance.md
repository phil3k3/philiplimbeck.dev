- Automate your finance
	- Keep what you need on one account, immediatley move the rest to another savings account
	- invest a certain percentage from the other savings account to an ETF automatically
- Pay yourself first (don't save what is left from your expenses, but take away savings right away)
- Especially with small regular investments, fees are your biggest enemy to try to avoid them as good as you can
- Only stock pick if you have done your homework (balance sheets, industry, numbers, etc..) and you made an invstement case, ideally based on an edge you have
  compared to other investors
- If you didn't do you research or don't have time for it, stick with index funds (ETFs), ideally you have an "edge" (an insight, an advantage) to other investors, because for example you work in the industry
- Keep at least 20-30% in cash ,depending on your risk-avoidance and age (the older and less risk averse, more cash)
- Start early, compounding makes up a big factor in your long term gains (i.e. start now)
- Don't overspend, cancel anything you haven't used in the last 2 months at least 5 times (i.e. gym, Netflix, etc...)
- Convert your spendings from personal consumption (clothing, accessories, eletronics) to personal investing (books, courses, networking events, ....)
- If you have a mortage, don't pay it back if you interest rates are much lower than your potential average future gains on the stock market
- If you start from scratch, don't invest in stocksÂ  but invest in yourself to setup and expand your income streams first
- If it crashes, you should consider buying in, with every -10% you should by more stock
- Choose a strategy with which you are able to sleep at night, not the one giving you the greatest return
	- if it's a lot of cash, so be it
	- if it's index funds so bit
- Be aware that other investors have another time horizons and goals, so you are not playing their game, but your own game (?)
- Live below your means
- Don't optimize before having a high savings rate
- Never interrupt your path
