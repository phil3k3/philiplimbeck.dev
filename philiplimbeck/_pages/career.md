# Healthy Software Engineer Guide
As we all know, [Software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). That means that more and more people decide
to work as software engineer, QA engineer or product owner. The diversity regarding the peoples personalities', skill-sets', skin-colors', sexual orientations' and genders' increased dramatically.
The widespread view of the overweight software engineer with glasses, pale skin and no social skills is slowly becoming a thing of the past.

As cloud computing became widely used and ubiquitous, traditional software development processes had to give way to a new way of developing and operating software, called _DevOps_. 
And although these advances are beneficial, they also lead to an increased stress level as software must be able to run reliably 24x7. Simple eCommerce web-shops became as critical 
to operate as nuclear reactors. 
  
These stress levels mean that to stay afloat this progress, software engineering as a career changes. People working in the tech industry are not just smart people.
They increasingly understand that in order to achieve their goals and build the best solutions possible, their body needs to stay fit as well.

This is not about special chairs to support back problems, it starts with a work ethic which uses automation, smart solutions and 
to do more with less. It is about making your brain and your body as efficent as possible to stay focussed and mentally clear for many consecutive hours.

To get to the stage where your work output becomes smart, you need to sleep smart, you need to eat smart, you need to meditate for improved focus, 
you need to workout and you need to set aside time for social life and fresh air. You need to have fun at work and in your life as a whole. 
Going the extra mile in a smart and efficient way becomes much easier when your body is healthy and balanced. 

The following bullet point list are my personal pillars for building a remarkable career as a software engineer or any related position in the tech sector. You might disagree with one or the other
item, which is fine as well, but I want you use it as a blueprint to build your own principles on how to move forward. 

* Sleep 

Don't stay awake to binge watch the latest series. But you also don't need to up at 5 am just because you want to squeeze more activities in. There are many guides 
on how to optimize sleep, but I recommend not saving on matresses and pillows. Investing in sleep equipment means investing in your well-being. Avoid electronics in your bedroom, especially your phone.
Ideally your bedroom is for sleeping only (mostly). Ideally also your desk is located in a different room, to mentally associate the bedroom with sleep.

If you want to understand the importance and the background of effective sleep I can recommend _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ by Matthew Walker PhD
([Amazon de](https://amzn.to/38FNK0O )| [Amazon en](https://amzn.to/34Oga82)).

* Eat

Your brain works on different types of nutritional elements, such as vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates. It consumes over 20% of your energy for a body mass of only 2% of your whole body. 
Consuming vegetable rich food, but also meat, fish, nutes and whole-grain carbs will help your brain to function properly. It doensn't mean that you can't eat sugary or otherwise unhealthy food, as long
as it stays the exception not the rule. So yes, you can have a delicious Burrito or other things once a while. Try to stick to the golden rule - if you see advertisements for it, avoid it.  Regarding
your daily Vitamin requirements, it's best to check with your doctor for any deficiencies first before taking supplements. 

This article gives a good primer on brain food and a healthy diet: [https://healthybrains.org/pillar-nutrition/](https://healthybrains.org/pillar-nutrition/). TLDR; Eat like the Italians do. 
The gist of it is to eat whatever makes you feel productive and healthy and does not drag you down and lowers your energy levels. 

* Exercise

You are sitting a lot, quite a lot. Sitting is recently considered as severe to your health as smoking by the public media. Be aware that there are [serious research papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187798/) out there which defused
this argument as unwarranted comparison. Still, widespread conclusion stays that sitting too much without exercise will do you harm in the long run. So don't just commute from your office desk to the couch. 
Instead, set aside at least 30 minutes of time during the day for walking, running, gym, yoga, Karate or whatever activity you may prefer. You don't need to become an athlete, but increasing your fitness level also increases your energy levels, which means you can think faster, have more focus and more energy to push through any challenge in your work day. 
In addition, it has the benefit of balancing out the negative effects of sitting. 

* Chair

Ask for the best chair your employer can get you. If you are working from home, organize one yourself and don't be thrifty as it highly affects the health of your back muscles, 
tendons, basically a lot more in your body than you think. It is less about which chair you pick, but given the discovery made abvoe (i.e. you are sitting a lot), pick one which you
find comfortable sitting in for many hours. It also needs be adjustable to your body weight, height and arms lengths to have the correct distances to monitor, keyboard and the desk. 
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=F8_ME4VwTiw) gives you a good introduction on where to place your desk items in relation to your chair.

* Tools

Get the best tools money can buy. If you are 50% faster with a mechanical keyboard (which I am), then get yourself one, but not without considering the [options](https://medium.com/@jackyfeng530/a-brief-introduction-to-the-world-of-mechanical-keyboards-60009f8a0aa9) first. 
Also consider one or more big screens to get more overview on what are you working on and what is going on in your codebase. Get a powerful laptop, learn your OS inside out, learn to optimize it and run it. Once you have a software setup
which is to your convinence, backup your configuration to be able to quickly restore it on a different laptop should yours fail. Just like with infrastructure which runs services, you don't want to risk a lengthy downtime as you have to spend time to restore it manually. 

* Alocohol and Caffein

It is fine to drink Alcohol, but if you notice any side effects, such as decreased energy levels during the day or sleeping problems, avoid it.
Caffein is a stimulant and should be used wisely. Don't have five coffees just because you feel more productive, but then gives you problems falling asleep later. Anything which 
affects sleep is bad for you. Studies show that any caffein intake after 2 pm can affect your circadian rythym and natural sleep (see bullet point 'Sleep')

* NO Drugs

I know that micro-dosing is a thing, but it's a game with your dopamin levels many people have lost.

* Meditate

Regular mediation allows you to stay more focussed and mindful on what is going on in the present moment. This is essential for supporting mission-critical software which is supposed to run 24x7. 
When an incident occurs, you want to be fully alert and in the present moment, able to analyze and address the problem at hand. Therefore, skipping meditation can mean the difference between making things worse by reacting in a compulsive way during a system outage, instead of calmly but swiftly responding
to the problem and being the hero of the day.

* Read

Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body. A [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12307) published in 2015 shows that children who grew up sourrounded by books stay in the education system substantially longer.
In turn, staying a year longer in the edcuation system results in an increase of lifetime earnings by 9%.  
The information density in books is much higher compared to videos or audio content. So if you want to ingest as much information as possible about a specific topic, reading is the best way forward. I suggest
getting a Kindle ([Amazon de](https://amzn.to/37RRkGe) \| [Amazon en](https://amzn.to/2WSKR7q) ) as it allows you to carry thousands of books with you at all times.

For recommendations on inspiring books to read, see my [Bookshelf]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/bookshelf.md %}). 

* Communicate

You can't really move forward in your career as software engineer when you cannot communicate efficiently and clearly. That is, be precise, don't leave out information and learn to articulate your thoughts on a problem so that others can join in and support you.
Software engineering is purely writing code but about finding solutions to problems. If are not able to convey these problems and your solutions in both written and spoken ways, then you won't be able to have peers help you solve the problem jointly.  
Another important fact related to communication is to let your team, your manager, your product manager,... know what they can expect and what you are up against. Under-communication is always worse than over-communication.    
    
* Lunch break

Eating lunch at your desk psychologically keeps you in your problem-solving mode and you don't really step back from your problems but keep pondering about them. 
My experience is that many problems are solved after a break, as you are able to let your subconscious mind deal with it.    

* Finance

Learn to save and don't overspend. Consumption keeps you side-tracked on what actually matters in life and usually leaves you less time to improve yourself. That being said, you should still focus
on building up wealth. Don't look at money a means to consume, but a means to create and extend your freedom in life. 

* Relationships

It is quite possible to regularly encounter people who will drain your positive energy and attitude towards life. You can only
solve this by avoiding people altogether, which is even less beneficial. A better strategy is to deal with these people
productively and do you best to contain their influence to you and your success. In they worst case though, you have to consider cutting them 
out of your life completely, especially when they try to sabotage your efforts to improve yourself.

Keep in mind that end up being the the average of the five people you spend most of your time with, so anybody in your inner circle with habits contradicting yours might lead to worse results in your goals. 
If you surround yourself with people who smoke, you run the risk of smoking as well. They define how your life is led to quite big extend, making you prone to jeopardizing your health and your success.
