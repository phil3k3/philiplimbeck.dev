# Healthy Software Engineer Guide
As we all know, [Software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). But that means that more and more people decide
for themselves to work as software engineer, QA engineer or product owner. This new form of diversity regarding the peoples personalities', skill-sets', skin-colors', sexual orientations' and genders' increased dramatically.
The widespread view of the overweight software engineer with glasses, pale skin and no social skills is slowly becoming a thing of the past.

Another remarkable development is the introduction of the DevOps paradigm and cloud computing now being ubiquitous. That means
that traditional software development processes don't really adjust nicely to this new way of developing and operating software. And although these advances are beneficial,
they also lead to an increased stress level as software must be able to run reliably 24x7. Simple eCommerce web-shops became as critical 
to operate as nuclear reactors. 
  
These stress levels mean that to stay afloat this progress, software engineering as a career changes. People working in the tech industry are not just smart people.
They increasingly understand that in order to achieve software engineering and furthermore carreer goals and build the best solutions possible, their body needs to stay fit as well.

This is not about special chairs to support back problems, it starts with a work ethic which uses automation, smart solutions and 
do more with less. It is about making your brain and your body as efficent as possible to focus for 6 hours and be done for the day in contrast to 
dragging yourself through 10 hours of work, almost providing no real progress.

To get to the stage where your work output becomes smart, you need to live smart, you need to eat smart, you need to sleep, you need to meditate for improved focus, 
you need to workout, you need to set aside time for social life and fresh air. You need to have fun at work and in your 
life. Going the extra mile in smart and efficient way becomes much easier when your body is healthy and balanced. 

The following bullet point list are my personal pillars for building a remarkable career as a software engineer or any related position in the tech sector. You might disagree with one or the other
item, which is fine as well, but I want you use it as a blueprint to build your own principles on how to move forward. 

* Sleep 

Don't stay awake to binge watch the latest series. But you also don't get up at 5 am just because you want to squeeze more life-improving activities in. There are many guides 
on how to optimize sleep, but I recommend not saving on matresses and pillows, investing in sleep material is critical. Don't take the phone
or worse the laptop into the bed. Ideally your bedroom is for sleeping and having sex only. Also don't work in your bedroom, put your desk somewhere else.

If you want to understand the reasons and the background on effective sleep I can recommend _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ by Matthew Walker PhD
([Amazon de](https://amzn.to/38FNK0O )| [Amazon en](https://amzn.to/34Oga82)).

* Eat

You can have a delicious Burrito or other things once a while, but otherwise stick to proteins, carbs and vegetable rich food. 
The golden rule - if you see advertisements for it, avoid it. Meat, fish, nuts, anything which keeps your brain going. Take supplements if
Vitamin tests find that you are low on Vitamin D for example. The brain uses the most calories of all your body.

Since your career depends to a quite large extend on the proper function and nutrition of our brain, anything which supports its mechanisms is beneficial to consume. 
This article gives a good primer on brain food and healthy diet: [https://healthybrains.org/pillar-nutrition/](https://healthybrains.org/pillar-nutrition/). TLDR; Eat like the Italians do. 
Be aware though that this topic is highly individual, as you might chose to not eat meat, or have other dietary preferences. The gist of it is to eat whatever makes you feel productive and healthy and does not d
drag you down and lowers your energy levels. 

* Exercise

You are sitting a lot, quite a lot. Don't just commute from your office desk to the couch. Instead, set aside at least 30 minutes of time during the day for walking, running
, gym, yoga, Karate or whatever activity you may prefer. You don't need to become an athlete, but increasing your fitness level also increases your energy
level, which means you can think faster, have more focus and more energy to push through any challenge in your work day. In addition, it has the 
benefit of balancing out the negative effects of sitting. As sitting is considered as severe to your health as smoking.  
A website dedicated to the risks of sitting vs the advantages of standing is: [https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/](https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/)

* Chair

Ask for the best chair your employer can get you. If you are working from home, organize one yourself and don't be thrifty as it highly affects the health of your back muscles, 
tendons, basically a lot more in your body than you think. Also the link mentioned above eloborates this topic further: [https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/](https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/)

* Tools

Get the best tools money can buy. If you are 50% faster with a mechanical keyboard (which I am), then get it. Also consider one or more big screens to get more overview
on what are you working on and what is going in your codebase. Get a powerful laptop, learn your OS inside out, learn to optimize it and run it. Once you have a setup
which is to your convinence, backup your configuration to be able to quickly restore it on a different laptop should yours fail. Just like with infrastructure which runs
services, you don't want to risk a lengthy downtime as you re-setup your working environment.  

* Alocohol and Caffein

It is fine to drink Alcohol, but if you notice any side effects, such as decreased energy levels during the day or sleeping problems, avoid it.
Caffein is a stimulant and should be used wisely. Don't have five coffees just because you feel more productive, but let's you end up having problems falling asleep later. Anything which 
affects sleep is bad for you. Studies show that any caffein intake after 2 pm can affect your circadian rythym and natural sleep (see bullet point 'Sleep')

* NO Drugs

Not sure what to say about that. I know that micro-dosing is a thing, but 

* Meditation

Regular mediation allows you to stay more focussed and mindful on what is going on in the present moment. This is essential for supporting mission-critical software which is supposed to run 24x7. 
When an incident occurs, you want to be fully alert and in the present moment, able to analyze and address the problem at hand.  
Therefore, skipping meditation can mean the difference between making things worse by reacting in a compulsive way during a system outage, instead of calmly but swiftly responding
to the problem and being the hero of the day.

* Reading

Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body. People who read are according to many studies (ref) much more successful 
than people who don't. In addition, the information density in books is much higher compared to videos or audio content.
So if you want to ingest as much information as possible about a specific topic, reading is the best way forward. I suggest
getting a Kindle ([Amazon de](https://amzn.to/37RRkGe) \| [Amazon en](https://amzn.to/2WSKR7q) ) as it allows you to carry thousands of books with you at all times.

For recommendations on which books to read to give you a positive mindset, see my [Bookshelf]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/bookshelf.md %}). 

* Communicate

You can't really move forward in your career as software engineer when you cannot communicate efficiently and clearly. That is, be precise
, don't leave out information and be able to articulate your thoughts on a problem so that others can join in and support you.
Software engineering is not just about writing code but about finding solutions to problems. If are not able to convey these problems and your solutions in both written and spoken ways, 
then you won't be able to have peers help you solve the problem jointly. Another important fact related to communication is to let your peers, your manager, your team, your product manager etc..
know what they can expect and what you are up against. Under-communication is always worse than over-communication.    
    

* Dedicate time to a lunch break

Eating lunch at your desk psychologically keeps you in your problem-solving mode and you don't really step back from your problems but keep pondering about them. 
My experience is that many problems are solved after a break, as you are able to let your subconscious mind deal with it.    

* Take care of your relationships

It is quite possible to regularly encounter people who will drain your positive energy and attitude towards life. You can only
avoid this by avoiding people altogether, which is even less beneficial. But that means you have to be able to deal with these people
productively and do you best to contain their influence to you and your success. In they worst case, you have to consider cutting them
 out of your life completely, especially when they try to sabotage your efforts to improve yourself.  
You tend to be the average of the five people you spend most
of your time with, so anybody in your inner circle with habits contradicting yours might lead to worse results in your goals. If you surround
yourself with people who smoke, you run the risk of smoking as well. They define how your life is led to quite big extend, making you prone to 
jeopardizing your health and your success.
