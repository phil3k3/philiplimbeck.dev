# Healthy Software Engineer Guide
As we all know Software is eating the world (link) leading to the diversity regarding personalities, skill-sets, skin-colors, sexual orientation and genders increase dramatically.
The widespread view of the overweight software engineer with glasses, pale skin and no social skills is slowly becoming a thing of the past.

Another remarkable development is the introduction of the DevOps paradigm and and cloud computing now being now ubiquituos. That means
that classical processes don't really adjust nicely to this new way of operating software. Although these advances are beneficial,
they also led to an increased stress level on making sure software is up and running 24/7. Simple eCommerce web-shops became as critical 
to operate as nuclear reactors. 
  
This stress level means that to stay afloat this progress, software engineering as a career changes. People working in the tech industry are not just smart people.
People understand that in order to achieve goals nad build the best solutions possible, your body needs to stay fit as well.

This is not about special chairs to support back problems, it starts with a work ethic which uses automation, smart solutions and 
do more with less. How can you focus for 6 hours and then stop vs dragging yourself through 10 hours of work, almost providing no real progress.

To get to the stage where your work output becomes smart, you need to live smart, you need to eat smart, you need to sleep, you need to meditate,
to give you focus, you need to workout, you need to set time for social life and fresh air, You need to have fun at work and in your 
life, then you are ready to go the extra mile, but in a smart way. 

This little bullet point list is a strart on how to build a remarkable carreer as a software engineer or otherwise related position in the tech sector.

* Sleep 

Don't stay awak too long watching shit, also don't get up at 5 just because you want to do squeeze activities in. There are many guides 
on how to optimize sleep, but I recommend not saving on matresses and pillows, investing in sleep material is critical. Don't take the phone
or worse the laptop into the bed. Ideally your bedroom is for sleeping and having sex only. Also don't work in your bedroom, put your desk somewhere else.

* Eat

You can have a delicious Burrito or other things once a while, but otherwise stick to proteins, carbs, vegetable rich food, 
The golden rule, if you see advertisements for it, avoid it. Mean, fish, nuts, anything which keeps your brain going. Take supplements if
Vitamin tests find that you are low on Vitamin D for example. The brain uses the most calories of all your body.

* Exercise

You are sitting a lot, quite a lot. Don't go from your office desk to the couch, set aside at least 30 minutes of walking,running
,gym,yoga or whatever you may prefer

* Chair

Get the best chair you can efford, if you are working at home. Ask for the best chair you can get in the office

* Tools

Get the best tools money can buy. If you are 50% faster with a mechnical keyboard (which I am) get it, get big screens a powerful
laptop, learn your OS inside out, learn to optimize it, to run it, use smart ways to backup your configuration or you will 
lose time (and data) to set everything back up (time = money)

* Alocohol and coffein

It is fine to drink, but if you notice any side effects and be it just a little more tired on the next day, avoid it
Coffein should be used as a stimulant and wisely, don't have 5 coffees for the sake of productivity, anything which 
affects sleep is bad for you.

* NO Drugs

For real

* Meditation

Mediation increases your focus throughot the day and you are more calm in stressful situations, especially when performed regullarly
it can mean the difference between making things worse by reacting in a wrong way during a system outage, or calmly but swiftly responding
to the problem and being the hero of the day.

* Reading

If you want to optimize your information intake, don't watch documentaries or youtube, just read a book, get a kindle 
to have them all at hand anytime. Read whenever you find time, it should be a habit to read on a daily basis. 

* Communicate

Especially in a remote environment, over-communicate, tell your peers what you are did, what you are doing, and what you plan to do.
Mention roadblocks immediately, don't let people guess where you might be. 

* Address anything immediately

Either solve it or create tickets for it in your issue tracker of choice

* Try to do everything in 6 hours

Yes you get paid for 8 hours, but what counts is the outcome not the time, if you can manage to set aside 2 hours
for advancing your software engineering career, you will easily be able to manage to do everything you planned in 6 hours before.

* Don't have a long lunch

It gets you in a lazy mode where it's hard to get back to work

* Have lunch away from your desk to distract yourself
