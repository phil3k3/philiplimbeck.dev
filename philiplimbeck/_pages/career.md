# Healthy Software Engineer Guide
As we all know, [Software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). But that means that more and more people decide
for themselves to work as software engineer, QA engineer or product owner. This new form of diversity regarding the peoples personalities', skill-sets', skin-colors', sexual orientations' and genders' increased dramatically.
The widespread view of the overweight software engineer with glasses, pale skin and no social skills is slowly becoming a thing of the past.

Another remarkable development is the introduction of the DevOps paradigm and cloud computing now being ubiquitous. That means
that traditional software development processes don't really adjust nicely to this new way of developing and operating software. And although these advances are beneficial,
they also lead to an increased stress level as software must be able to run reliably 24x7. Simple eCommerce web-shops became as critical 
to operate as nuclear reactors. 
  
These stress levels mean that to stay afloat this progress, software engineering as a career changes. People working in the tech industry are not just smart people.
They increasingly understand that in order to achieve software engineering and furthermore carreer goals and build the best solutions possible, their body needs to stay fit as well.

This is not about special chairs to support back problems, it starts with a work ethic which uses automation, smart solutions and 
do more with less. It is about making your brain and your body as efficent as possible to focus for 6 hours and be done for the day in contrast to 
dragging yourself through 10 hours of work, almost providing no real progress.

To get to the stage where your work output becomes smart, you need to live smart, you need to eat smart, you need to sleep, you need to meditate for improved focus, 
you need to workout, you need to set aside time for social life and fresh air. You need to have fun at work and in your 
life. Going the extra mile in smart and efficient way becomes much easier when your body is healthy and balanced. 

This little bullet point list are pillars for building a remarkable career as a software engineer or any related position in the tech sector.

* Sleep 

Don't stay awake to binge watch the latest series. But you also don't get up at 5 am just because you want to squeeze more life-improving activities in. There are many guides 
on how to optimize sleep, but I recommend not saving on matresses and pillows, investing in sleep material is critical. Don't take the phone
or worse the laptop into the bed. Ideally your bedroom is for sleeping and having sex only. Also don't work in your bedroom, put your desk somewhere else.

If you want to understand the reasons and the background on effective sleep I can recommend _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ by Matthew Walker PhD
([Amazon de](https://amzn.to/38FNK0O )| [Amazon en](https://amzn.to/34Oga82)).

* Eat

You can have a delicious Burrito or other things once a while, but otherwise stick to proteins, carbs and vegetable rich food. 
The golden rule - if you see advertisements for it, avoid it. Meat, fish, nuts, anything which keeps your brain going. Take supplements if
Vitamin tests find that you are low on Vitamin D for example. The brain uses the most calories of all your body.

Since your career depends to a quite large extend on the proper function and nutrition of our brain, anything which supports its mechanisms is beneficial to consume. 
This article gives a good primer on brain food and healthy diet: https://healthybrains.org/pillar-nutrition/. Be aware though, that this is a recommendation and that 
there are other contradicting ones out there. In combination with your fitness level, it is important though to keep discipline and good habits
when it comes to food and snacks. To avoid cues, you could just stop buying sweets and snacks, so that they simply become unavailable when you crave them. 

* Exercise

You are sitting a lot, quite a lot. Don't just commute from your office desk to the couch. Instead, set aside at least 30 minutes of time during the day for walking, running
, gym, yoga, Karate or whatever activity you may prefer. You don't need to become an athlete, but increasing your fitness level also increases your energy
level, which means you can think faster, have more focus and more energy to push through any challenge in your work day. In addition, it has the 
benefit of balancing out the negative effects of sitting. As sitting is considered as severe to your health as smoking.  
A website dedicated to the risks of sitting vs the advantages of standing is: https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/

* Chair

Ask for the best chair your employer can get you. If you are working from home, organize one yourself and don't be thrifty as it highly affects the health of your back muscles, 
tendons, basically a lot more in your body than you think. Also the link menioned above eloborates this topic further: https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/

* Tools

Get the best tools money can buy. If you are 50% faster with a mechanical keyboard (which I am) get it, get big screens a powerful
laptop, learn your OS inside out, learn to optimize it, to run it, use smart ways to backup your configuration or you will 
lose time (and data) to set everything back up (time = money) (refer to the software engineering career book). I am using the Cherry MX with Brown Switches. 
Mechanical keyboards are known for their durability, precision and latency, making them ideal for 
gamers. But  even if you are just typing a lot, it already pays off. An overview on the different switches
can be found at https://www.hyperxgaming.com/austria/us/keyboards/switches#:~:text=CHERRY%20MX%20Red%20and%20CHERRY,enjoy%20the%20edge%20in%20speed.

* Alocohol and caffein

It is fine to drink Alcohol, but if you notice any side effects and only you notice that your are a little more tired on the next day, avoid it.
Caffein is a stimulant and should be used wisely. Don't have 5 coffees just because you are more productive, anything which 
affects sleep is bad for you. Studies show that any caffein intake after 2 pm can affect your circadian rythym and natural sleep (see bullet point 'Sleep')

* NO Drugs

Not sure what to say about that.

* Meditation

Regular mediation allows you to stay more focussed and mindful on what is going on in the present moment. 
This is essential for supporting mission-critical software running 24x7. 
When something happens, you want to be fully alert and in the present moment, being able to analyze and address the problem at hand.  
Therefore skipping meditation can mean the difference between making things worse by reacting in a compulsive way during a system outage, instead of calmly but swiftly responding
to the problem and being the hero of the day.

* Reading

Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body. People who read are according to many studies (ref) much more successful 
than people who don't. In addition, the information density in books is much higher than when you are watching videos or listen
to audio. So if you want to ingest as much information as possible about a topic, reading is the best way forward. I suggest
getting a Kindle (amazon affilite marketing link) as it can store thousands of books which you have at hand at all times instead
of taking them with you.

See my bookshelf for books I can absolutely recommend to read to ensure you have a positive mindset which helps you shape your career, financial success
and your relationships.


* Communicate

You can't really move forward in your career as software engineer when you cannot communicate efficiently. That is, be precise
, don't leave out information and be able to articulate your thoughts on a problem so that others can join in and support you.
Software engineering is not just about coding but about finding solutions to problems on a daily basis. If are not able
to convery these problems and your solutions in both written and oral ways, then you won't be able to have peers solve big
problems jointly. Another importance attributed to communication is to let your peers, your manager, your team, your product manager etc..
know what they can expect and what you are up against. Under-communication is way worse than over-communication.    
    

* Don't eat lunch at your desk

Eating lunch at your desk psychologically keeps you in your problem solving mode and you don't have a change to literally
step back from the problem and do something else. My experience is that many problems are solved after a break as you are able
to approach the problem from a different angle.    

* Take care of your relationships

Especially in your free time you will encounter people who drain your positive energy and attitude towards life. It is at
best for you and your career to avoid them completely. If they do you a large amount of mental harm or put themselves 
between you and your success, simply cut them out of your life. You tend to be the average of the five people you spend most
of your time with, so anybody in your inner circle with habits contradicting yours might lead to worse results in your goals. If you surround
yourself with people you smoke, you run the risk of smoking as well. The same goes with people who don't take care of their health
and their success. All of these factors have the risk of dragging you down eventually.
