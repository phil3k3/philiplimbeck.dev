To show my passion about the possibilities of Web3, I volunteered to give a presentation at one of the meetups I am attending regularly. It summarized the Crypto-market as well
as the options a beginner has in terms of investing and pointed out opportunities and risks. Feedback was great so far, given the diverse audience of both Crypto-beginners as well as experts
who know the ins and outs of the EVM. You can download the slides here, feel free to reach out for questions/feedback.
