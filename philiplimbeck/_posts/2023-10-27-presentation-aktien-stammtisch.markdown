To sharpen my presentation skills as well as show my passion about the possibilities of Web3, I decided
to give a presentation at one of the meetups I am attending regularly. It summarized the Crypto-market as well
as the options a beginner has and pointed out opportunities and risks. You can download the slides here, feel 
free to reach out for questions/feedback.
